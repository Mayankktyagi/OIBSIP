The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales based on advertising expenditures across various media channels, including Radio, TV, and Newspaper. By utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, the goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting sales. This project will analyze the relationships between advertising spend and sales, evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared, and ultimately provide actionable insights to optimize advertising strategies for better business outcomes. Additionally, the project aims to visualize key findings to enhance understanding of sales drivers and model performance. By delivering a robust predictive solution, this initiative will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve marketing effectiveness, contributing to overall business growth.
