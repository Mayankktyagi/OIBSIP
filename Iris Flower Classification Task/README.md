The Iris flower classification dataset comprises a total of 150 samples of Iris flowers, which are divided into three distinct species:

1). Iris setosa 2). Iris versicolor 3). Iris virginica

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their morphological features. This involves the following key goals:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyze the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features and handle any missing or inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering: Identify and select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the classification task.

Model Development: Implement various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors, to find the most effective model.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust classification.

Visualization and Interpretation: Visualize the results and decision boundaries of the models to interpret their behavior and understand their decision-making process.

By achieving these goals, the project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in solving a classical classification problem and provide insights into the strengths and limitations of different algorithms in this context.
