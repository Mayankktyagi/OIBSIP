The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the selling price of a car based on various features such as the year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, selling type, transmission type, and ownership history. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide an efficient and reliable tool for potential car buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. The ultimate goal is to enhance the transparency and efficiency of the used car market, thereby facilitating fair pricing and smoother transactions.
